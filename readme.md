# Math Makes Flowers! ðŸŒ¸âœ¨

Welcome to **Math Makes Flowers!** ðŸŒ¸âœ¨

This project is a fun and visually captivating way to see how mathematics can create beautiful, flower-like patterns. Originally written in C# as an old project of mine to get familiar with the language, I've decided to convert it to Python and release it to the world. It's very, very, very rough around the edges, but that's part of its charm! ðŸŒ»

## What Does This Code Do?

This Python application uses mathematical functions to plot mesmerizing graphs that look like flowers. The patterns are generated using trigonometric functions, and you can play around with the parameters to create different shapes and designs.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI:** Adjust the parameters using sliders and see the changes in real-time.
- **Play/Pause:** Animate the flower patterns with adjustable speed.
- **Open Source:** Feel inspired? Submit your changes and improvements!

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/math-makes-flowers.git
    cd math-makes-flowers
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Dependencies

- `tkinter` for the GUI
- `matplotlib` for plotting the graphs
- `numpy` for mathematical computations
- `Pillow` for handling the play and pause button icons

Make sure you have these installed before running the application.

## How to Use

1. **Adjust the Sliders:**
    - **Iterations:** Number of points in the graph.
    - **n and m:** Parameters that influence the shape of the flower.
    
2. **Choose a Function:** Select from different trigonometric functions to create various patterns.

3. **Play/Pause Animation:** Use the play and pause buttons to animate the graph. Adjust the speed to control the animation speed.

4. **Enjoy the Flowers:** Sit back and watch as mathematical functions create beautiful flower patterns.
